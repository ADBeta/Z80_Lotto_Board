# Z80 Lotto Board - Software

The [original software](https://github.com/ADBeta/Z80_Lotto_Board/blob/main/Software/original_rom.bin)
has been dumped from the UV EPROM.

The ASCII strings inside this ROM have also been [extracted seperately](https://github.com/ADBeta/Z80_Lotto_Board/blob/main/Software/original_rom_strings.txt)
as they contain extra information about the board and original usecase.

(TODO) The code will be reverse engineered soon
