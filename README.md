# Z80 Lottery Board
![image](https://github.com/ADBeta/Z80_Lotto_Board/blob/main/Images/Main_Board_Overview.png)

This project is about the reverse engineering, modification and development for
a Z80 based Lottery Game PCB that was found on eBay.

From the sellers description, this board was designed as a Lottery "game" for
the entertainment industry. I assume this to mean the equivilent of a 
Poker, or Fruit Machine (aka One-Armed-Bandit).

The schematics were done in 1999, The Original ROM has copyright dates of 
1999 and 2001, and the Seller says that the boards were defunct in 2002.

The Kit came with a `PSU Board`, `Main Board`, and `IO Board` - The main board
is Z80 Based, clocked at 4.9152 MHz, with 32KB RAM and 32KB UV Erasable EPROM.

The Original EPROM Software had been dumped, and is [here](https://github.com/ADBeta/Z80_Lotto_Board/blob/main/Software/original_rom.bin),
along with the reverse engineering of it.
