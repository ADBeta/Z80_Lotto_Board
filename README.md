![image](https://github.com/ADBeta/Z80_Lotto_Board/blob/main/Images/Main_Board_Overview.png)

This project is about the reverse engineering, modification and development for
a Z80 based Lottery Game PCB that was found on eBay.

From the sellers description, this board was designed as a Lottery "game" for
the entertainment industry. I assume this to mean the equivilent of a 
Poker, or Fruit Machine (aka One-Armed-Bandit).

According to the Schematics, it was designed in 1999, according to the seller,
there were 24 left unused as NOS, and they stopped installing them in 2002.  
A abridged description from the seller is as follows:  
```
The unused and brand new SBC kit consists of 3 boards; the Z80 processor board,
keyboard and a functional +12V unregulated and +5Vdc regulated power supply with
an additional 9V ac supply

The SBC kit was designed for use in a lottery machine circa 2002. [...]
I have cleared the storage area and are now surplus equipment.
```

The Kit came with a `PSU Board`, `Main Board`, and `IO Board` - The main board
is Z80 Based, clocked at 4.9152 MHz, with 32KB RAM and 32KB UV Erasable EPROM.
